We will build this with a **NoSQL** db first (ie: lowdb, the only way we know how) to understand the problems with this approach. \n\n### DB Requirements\n\nHere are the DB requirements. You'll want to use **lowdb** for this probably.\n\n**NOTE**: you can add more stuff to your tables if you needed.\n\n#### Users\n\n**email**: email address, text\n\n**name**: text\n\n**id**: number\n\n#### Places\n\n**id**: number\n\n**name**: text\n\n#### Checkins\nOpen ended, implemented however it makes sense to you\n\n### Implementation Requirements\n\nYour code should be able to:\n\n1. Create a new user\n2. Find user by ID\n3. Create new place\n4. Find place by ID\n5. Check in existing user to place\n6. Find all checkins by a particular user\n7. Find all checkins by users to a particular place\n\n### Details\n\nI don't care if this has a server or not. I don't want a frontend - just focus on implementing the functions you would need to: \n\n1. Create users\n2. Create places (just seed like 5 for now)\n3. Create checkins where an existing user can \"checkin\" to an existing place.\n\n### Example\n\nTo implement the requirements, you might want to do something like...\n\n```js\ncreateUser(email, name);\n// creates a user with id, email, name attributes\n\nfindUserById(id);\n// finds you user by id\n```\n\nFor places, you would have similar methods as well.\n\nFor your checkins, you might want osmething like:\n\n```js\ncheckinUser(userId, placeId);\n// create a new checkin fto a place by a user\n\ngetUserCheckins(userId);\n// get all checkins a user did\n\ngetPlaceCheckins(placeId);\n// find all users who have checked in\n\n```\n\n\n","idx":3},"sqlite":{"content":"# SQLite\n\nTo install for NodeJS, you will need to:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install --save sqlite\n```\n\n**[DOCS](https://github.com/kriasoft/node-sqlite/tree/master/migrations)**","idx":4},"__list__":["home","title","desc","warmup","sqlite"]}
